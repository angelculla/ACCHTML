Easy to use html code generator for ESP32 in Arduino
In the example file there are several comments to understand its usage

- All methods of acchtml uses absolute coordinates to locate their outputs
- In the file graph.inc there are graphics that will be placed embedded in the bin code
  you can use any tool to dump the images to text file
  I don't use filesystem because is more easy burn the ESP32 with only one binary
